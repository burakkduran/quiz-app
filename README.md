# QuizApp

## Overview

Welcome to my quiz app project! This project is a demonstration of my skills as a frontend developer, showcasing the use of various technologies and tools to create a dynamic and interactive quiz application.

## Technologies Used

- **React & Vite**
- **React Router Dom**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Axios**
- [Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)

## Lessons Learned

Throughout the development of this project, several key lessons were learned and skills were honed:

- **Integration of Third-Party APIs:** Working with the Trivia API required understanding how to integrate external APIs into a React application, handle API requests, and manage the data received.

- **React Router Implementation:** Using React Router Dom involved setting up routes, managing navigation, and ensuring a seamless user experience when moving between different sections of the app.

- **Tailwind CSS Styling:** Implementing styles with Tailwind CSS demonstrated the efficiency and flexibility of a utility-first approach to styling, allowing for quick and consistent design choices.

- **State Management in React:** Managing the state of the quiz app within the React components was a crucial aspect of the development process. Understanding and implementing state management principles in React contributed to a more robust and responsive application.

- **Loading screen:** The loading screen was implemented to provide a better user experience when waiting for the quiz questions to load. This was achieved by using loading message to indicate that the app is working.
